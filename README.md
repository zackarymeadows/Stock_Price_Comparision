# DQ Stock Analysis
In this exercise, stock data from excel sheets is explored, collected and displayed using VBA.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to compare the stockprices for DQ against other stocks in the energy sector. This was achieved by refactoring an existing script with mulitple buttons connecting to various functions into a simple function that loops through the data and displays all relevant information. 

### Results
By cycling through the raw data provided and calulating the yearly return for each stock, it's clear to see only two of the 12 Stocks net a positive retrun for both years. 
RUN and ENPH seem to be the most consisitently performing stock in the category of the energy sector.

Reducing all the code into one macro provided an easier user experience. Refactoring reduced the clutter of the worksheet, reducing the need for 3 seperate buttons into one concise operation for the user.
