Data Analysis of Stocks in comparison to DQ

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to compare the stockprices for DQ against stocks in a similar field. This was achieved by refactoring an existing script with mulitple buttons connecting to various functions into a simple click that loops through the data, collects, and displays all relevant information. 

### Results
By cycling through the raw data provided and calulating the yearly return for each stock, it's clear to see only two of the 12 Stocks net a positive retrun for both years. 
RUN and ENPH seem to be the most consisitently performing stock in the category of the energy sector.

### Summary
Refactoring the code was beneficial to the overall performance and readabilty in the data. 
Reducing all the code into one macro provided an easier user experience. Refactoring reduced the clutter of the worksheet, reducing the need for 3 seperate buttons into one concise operation for the user.
